<h2>The story</h2>

<p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came around to commiserate. They said</p> 

<p class="v1"><q>We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most unfortunate.</q></p>
   
<p class="a1"> The farmer said, <q>Maybe.</q></p>

<p>The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said, </p>
   
<p class="v1"><q>Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q></p>
   
<p class="a1">The farmer again said,<q>Maybe</q></p>

<p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg.The neighbors then said, </p>

<p class="v1"><q>Oh dear, that’s too <span class="bad">Bad</span></q></p>
<p class="a1">And the farmer responded, <q>Maybe</q></p>

<p>The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. 
   
<p class="v1">Again all the neighbors came around and said <q>Isn’t that great!</q>

<p class="a1">Again, he said, <q>Maybe</q></p>

<blockquote>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">Good</span> or <span class="bad">Bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">Good</span> fortune.<footer><cite><br>-Alan Watts, The Chinese Farmer</cite></blockquote></footer>

<blockquote>Conclusion: <span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are <span class="good">Good </span> for monkeys, but monkeys are not <span class="good">Good </span> for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</blockquote>
